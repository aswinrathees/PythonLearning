# Introduction to Tuples
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Tuples are created using parentheses ().
# Tuples are ordered, meaning the items have a defined order and can be accessed by their index.
# Tuples can contain different data types, including strings, integers, and even other tuples.
# Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change, add, or remove items after the tuple has been created.
# Tuples can be used to return multiple values from a function.
# Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists.
# Tuples can be unpacked into multiple variables.
# Tuples can be nested, meaning you can have a tuple inside another tuple.
# Tuples can be iterated over using loops.
# Tuples can be concatenated using the + operator.
# Tuples can be repeated using the * operator.  
# Tuples can be converted to lists using the list() function.
# Tuples can be converted to strings using the str() function.
# Tuples can be converted to sets using the set() function.
# Tuples can be converted to dictionaries using the dict() function.
# Tuples can be used to store multiple values of different data types.
# Tuples can be used to store multiple values of the same data type.
# Tuples can be used to store multiple values of different data types in a single variable.
# Tuples can be used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable.
# Tuples can be used to store multiple values of different data types in a single variable.

# Introduction to Tuples
print(tupleExample)  # Printing the tuple
print(tupleExample[0])  # Accessing the first item
print(tupleExample[1])  # Accessing the second item
print(tupleExample[2])  # Accessing the third item
print(tupleExample[0:2])  # Slicing the first two items

print(tupleExample + tupleExample2)  # Concatenating two tuples
print(tupleExample * 2)  # Repeating the tuple
